# Rendering Demo

### Setup

First clone the repository to the local machine:  
` git clone https://github.com/Mrcoole7890/RenderingDemo.git `

Second if Node.js is not installed the LTS version is availble at:  
[Node.js Download Site](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Verify that npm **AND** Node.js are installed  
` node -v `  
` npm -v `  

Within the root directory perform the command  
` npm install `  

Finally, run the command  
` npm start `

If done correctly, you should be able to access the spritesheet renderer at
